# Summary

The main focus of my professional history has been compilers & virtual
machines; and, in general, I love to tackle problems that require
creativity and mathematical precision.  In past lives, I've enjoyed
dabbling with functional programming, type and proof theory (I have
basic familiarity with Haskell and Agda).

# Work History

**Contributor, LLVM, Oct 2014 - Present**

I've been heavily involved[^commits] with the LLVM community, mostly
focusing on improving the mid-level optimizer.  I'm currently the code
owner for the Scalar Evolution and Induction Variable Simplification
passes.

**Software Engineer, Azul Systems, Sep 2013 - Present**

I am a software engineer at Azul Systems where I am a key contributor
to a JIT compiler for Java based on LLVM.  Over the course of the
project we have made significant changes to LLVM to better support
managed languages.  Amongst other things, we've added support for
precise compacting garbage collection, deoptimization, and have
improved LLVM's mid-level optimizer to better optimize Java. Most of
our work has been upstreamed to LLVM, and we have presented
talks summarizing our progress in the 2014[^talk2014] and
2015[^talk2015] US LLVM Developer Meetings.

**Software Engineering Intern, Google, May 2012 - July 2012**

As an intern, I worked on the V8 Javascript engine.  My project was to
move some of the more time consuming phases of V8's optimizing JIT,
Crankshaft, onto a second thread.  The project was a success, and by
the end of the internship I had this feature implemented and checked
in under an off by default flag[^v8work] (which was enabled by default
sometime in mid 2013).
