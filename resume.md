# Work History

**Contributor, LLVM, Oct 2014 - Present**

I've been heavily involved[^commits] with the LLVM community, mostly
focusing on improving the mid-level optimizer.  I'm currently the code
owner for the Scalar Evolution and Induction Variable Simplification
passes.  I regularly review code and participate in design
discussions.

**Software Engineer, Azul Systems, Sep 2013 - Present**

At Azul Systems I am a key contributor to a JIT compiler for Java
based on LLVM.  Over the course of the project we have made
significant changes to LLVM to better support managed languages.
Amongst other things, we've added support for precise compacting
garbage collection, deoptimization, and have improved LLVM's mid-level
optimizer to better optimize Java. Most of our work has been
upstreamed to LLVM, and we have presented talks summarizing our
progress in the 2014[^talk2014] and 2015[^talk2015] US LLVM Developer
Meetings.

**Software Engineering Intern, Google, May 2012 - July 2012**

As an intern, I worked on the V8 Javascript engine.  My project was to
move some of the more time consuming phases of V8's optimizing JIT,
Crankshaft, onto a second thread.  The project was a success, and by
the end of the internship I had this feature implemented and checked
in under an off by default flag[^v8work] (which was enabled by default
sometime in mid 2013).

# Skills

The main focus of my professional history has been compilers and
virtual machines.  In general, I look forward to tackling hard
technical challenges that require creativity and precision.

# Education
