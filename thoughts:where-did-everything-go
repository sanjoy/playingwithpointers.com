Where did everything go?

I used to maintain a Wordpress [1] powered blog at this domain to
which I would post, on an average, one blog entry a month.  As is very
well apparent, that has now been replaced by an ultra-minimalist
statically generated website.

My earlier blog was around for four years (2009 to 2013) when I shut
it down.  Over the years I noticed my posts getting more fragmented
and haphazard.  This wasn't unexpected, of course; I am (was?)  at an
age where things change rather rapidly.

Since my thoughts now feel more mature and consistent, I think this is
a good time to reboot my website with fresh aims and perspective.
Specifically, I wish to move away from the fickle-minded one-off blog
posts I used to publish to better thought-out "article" type writing.
I don't intend to install any form of commenting system -- I'm always
available for discussion on email.

To be clear, I don't have anything against Wordpress, it is a
fantastic piece of software if you're looking to host a proper blog.
For websites like this, though, I think clayoven [2] or something
similar is the best solution.
