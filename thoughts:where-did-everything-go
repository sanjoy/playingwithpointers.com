Where did everything go?

I used to maintain a Wordpress [1] powered blog at this domain to
which I would post, on an average, one blog entry a month.  As is very
well apparent, that has now been replaced by an ultra-minimalist
statically generated website.

My earlier blog was around for almost my whole college life (2009 to
2013) before I shut it down.  Over these years I noticed my posts
getting more fragmented, haphazard and generally out-of-sync with each
other.  While slightly distressing, this wasn't unexpected; I was
(am?)  at an age where personal views change rapidly and perspectives
are in flux.

Since my thoughts now feel more mature and consistent, I think this is
a good time to reboot my website.  Specifically, I wish to move away
from fickle-minded one-off blog posts to better thought-out, deeper
articles.  I don't intend to install any form of commenting system --
I'm always available for discussion on email.

To be clear, I don't have anything against Wordpress, it is a
fantastic piece of software if you're looking to host a proper blog.
For websites like this, though, which aren't really "blogs", I think
clayoven [2] or something similar is really the best solution.
