I am a software engineer who likes compilers, virtual machines, type
systems, logic, Pink Floyd, reading and Haskell. Currently I'm
employed by [Azul Systems][azul], where I work on their JVM. My work
is primarily focused on JIT compilers, but touches other parts of the
runtime too. This is a personal blog.

# contacting me

I'm reachable via email at `sanjoy@$this_domain`. I can also be found
on [Twitter][twitter], [Github][github] and [LinkedIn][linkedin]. I
lurk on FreeNode as `sanjoyd` (and usually hang around on
`#klug-devel`).
