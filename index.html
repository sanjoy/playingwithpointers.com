  <h1>writeups</h1>
  <p>Here I write things people interested in compilers, functional programming or computer science in general are likely to find interesting.  Most of these writeups assume some prior knowledge -- I'll get nothing written if I have to start from near-scratch for each one.</p>

  <p>I haven't bothered integrating a commenting system (apart from being a hassle, they make my posts look ugly), but I will always welcome and try my best to respond to emails.</p>

  <ul class="post-list">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
      <li>
        <span class="post-meta">{{ post.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</span>

        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
        </h2>
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>

  <p class="rss-subscribe">subscribe <a href="{{ "/feed.xml" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">via RSS</a></p>
