Thoughts

Here I write things people interested in compilers, functional
programming or computer science in general are likely to find
interesting.  Most of these writeups assume some prior knowledge --
I'll get nothing written if I have to start from near-scratch for each
one.

I haven't bothered integrating a commenting system (apart from being a
hassle, they make my posts look ugly), but I will always welcome and
try my best to respond to emails.
