Sanjoy Das

I am a software engineer who likes compilers, virtual machines, type
systems, logic, Pink Floyd, reading and Haskell.  Currently I'm
employed by Azul Systems [1], where I work on their JVM.  My work is
primarily focused on JIT compilers, but touches other parts of the
runtime too.  This is a personal blog.

*Contacting Me*

I'm reachable via email at `sanjoy@$this_domain`.  I can also be found
on Twitter [2], Github [3] and LinkedIn [4].  I lurk on FreeNode as
`sanjoyd` (and usually hang around on #klug-devel).
