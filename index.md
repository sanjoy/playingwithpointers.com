# about this website

I'm Sanjoy, and this is my presence on the Internet.  The entirety of
the website is a [blog][blog] that I sporadically update, and this
page.

Opinions expressed here are entirely personal.

# contact

I'm reachable via email at `sanjoy@${this_domain}`. I can also be
found on [Twitter][twitter], [Github][github] and
[LinkedIn][linkedin]. I lurk on FreeNode as `sanjoyd` (and usually
hang around in `#klug-devel`).

# professional information

I work as a software engineer, and I like compilers and virtual
machines.  I'm currently employed by [Azul Systems][azul].
