A rather _old_ email conversation I stumbled upon today, reproduced

That happens to our bodies too -- our muscle fibers constantly tear
and re-join, making the muscles that are used more, stronger and the
ones that are used less, weaker.  The whole idea behind a "better"
brain is that it is "better" at making certain connections than other
brains.  Unless, of course, you assert that *all* brains are equally
good at making these connections; which is something I'll again
disagree to. :)

But given a software development team your software can only get so good.

Mozart is a really bad example -- he used to compose from an age of
five.  Einstein knew calculus inside out before he was fifteen.

But let's say I still agree to the weaker version of the theory (which
I don't), that genes expedite intellectual progress in certain fields
but are not real barriers.  Say, when I'm five, I decide to become a
cook; something I have very little natural talent for.  I work hard
till I'm 25 and become a decent cook.  The problem is that this
"decent" isn't good enough!  The standards of cooking are set by
people who are genetically predisposed to be good cooks *and* have
worked hard, like me, all their lives.

Quoting from page v in NewScientist, July 2011: [1]

_More intriguingly, the studies also reveal that the heritability of
intelligence – the percentage of its variation in a particular
population that can be attributed to its variation in genes – steadily
increases with age. Heritability is less than 30 per cent before
children start school, rising to 80 per cent among western adults. In
fact, by adolescence, separated identical twins answer IQ tests almost
as if they were the same person and adoptees in the same household as
if they were strangers. The surprising conclusion is that most family
environments are equally effective for nurturing intelligence – the IQ
of an adult will be the same almost regardless of where he or she grew
up, unless the environment is particularly inhumane._
