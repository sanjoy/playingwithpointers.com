Inter-processor Interrupts

I had always been curious about the mechanism used by linux to preempt
processes out of the CPU's they're running on.  Turns out, on x86, it
uses the inter-processor interrupt mechanism [1] provided by xAPIC [2]
(and, more recently x2APIC [3]).

IPI allows system software (i.e. programs running in ring `0`) to
generate interrupts on another processor by writing to a model
specific register (`ICR` -- the interrupt command register).  This way
a task can be preempted by sending in an IPI to that CPU it is running
on.

Writing super-short, bite-sized blog posts is better than not blogging
at all, I hope. :)
